**Cursor for circuit boards.** An AI agent that designs, documents, and validates real PCBs from a prompt, working directly on existing KiCad repositories.

> **Status: early.** Phase 1 is implemented and the CLI runs. The [technical specification](openspec/specs/SPEC.md) is the source of truth; expect the surface to move before 1.0.

Full documentation lives at [docs.copperhead.sh](https://docs.copperhead.sh).

## What it is

An AI product-development agent for hardware: from a product brief to manufacturable files, firmware, and a build plan.

- **`copperhead create`**: full pipeline from a natural-language brief: spec, architecture, part selection, schematic, first-draft layout, then gerbers, firmware scaffold, and dev plan.
- **`copperhead do "<change>"`**: operates on an existing KiCad repo the way a coding agent operates on a codebase.

It reads and edits real `.kicad_sch` / `.kicad_pcb` files (s-expression text), maintains markdown design docs as memory, propagates every change across all artifacts that reference it, and verifies its own work by running `kicad-cli` ERC/DRC until the checks pass.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g copperhead   # or: npx copperhead check
```

### Requirements

- Node.js ≥ 20
- [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) ≥ 8 with `kicad-cli` on PATH
- One model backend: a locally installed, ChatGPT-authenticated [Codex CLI](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/codex/cli), or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`/`OPENAI_API_KEY` in the environment. `check` never calls an LLM.

## Quick start

In an existing KiCad repository:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...   # or OPENAI_API_KEY
copperhead init                # scaffold docs/ from the schematic; idempotent
copperhead do "add reverse-polarity protection on VIN"
copperhead check               # ERC + DRC + doc drift; no LLM, CI-safe
```

Starting from nothing instead? Write a product brief and run `copperhead create --brief brief.md`. The [examples/](examples/) directory has ready-made briefs sorted by difficulty, plus a note on which one is designed to fail.

### Use your existing Codex login

No model API key is needed when Codex CLI is already authenticated:

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex-sdk   # optional adapter, loaded only for --model codex
codex login status
copperhead do "rename net KEY_DAH to KEY_DASH" --model codex
```

Plain `codex` follows your Codex model configuration. Use `codex:<model-id>` for an explicit model. If the executable is not on `PATH`, set `COPPERHEAD_CODEX_PATH=/absolute/path/to/codex`.

## How it works

It's a loop, and it looks a lot like pair-programming, except the codebase is a circuit board.

1. **Start from the docs.** Every decision lives in the design docs, so the agent reads those first and knows the whole design, not just the part in front of it.
2. **Talk through the change.** Describe what you want ("add an external key jack", "cut the sleep current"). The agent proposes the parts and circuit; you push back until the reasoning holds up.
3. **Edit the real files.** The agent writes changes straight into the KiCad schematic and the design docs, using the same part names and net names everywhere so nothing drifts.
4. **Propagate.** Change one value, like a charge current or a pin, and it carries across every doc and schematic that references it. The boring, easy-to-get-wrong step is the one the agent is best at.
5. **Check the work.** The agent runs ERC/DRC, reads the errors back, and fixes them. Nothing is "done" until the tools agree.
6. **Write down why.** Every real decision gets a one-line reason next to it, so the next change doesn't quietly undo it.

Two invariants make this trustworthy:

1. **Nothing starts without a spec.** The agent cannot touch a KiCad file until a validated change proposal exists; the edit tools are structurally unavailable until it does. Every edit is traceable to a documented intent.
2. **Nothing is "done" until the tools agree.** Every file mutation is followed by an ERC/DRC run before the agent reports success.

Spec-gated in, verification-gated out: the design can't drift from its requirements, because drift is a build failure.

## CLI

```text
copperhead init [--path hardware/]   # scaffold docs/ from an existing schematic; idempotent
copperhead do "<change request>"     # the core loop: propose, edit, verify, propagate, commit
copperhead check                     # ERC + DRC + doc-drift + spec validation; no LLM calls (alias: verify)
copperhead sync [--dry-run]          # verify the whole design state, resolve drift
copperhead create --brief brief.md   # brief → full output package
```

Global flags: `--repo <path>` (default: cwd) and `--json` for machine-readable output. `do` and `create` take `--model` and `--interactive`; `do` also takes `--dry-run`, `--max-turns`, and `--allow-dirty`.

Nothing is a black box: decisions land in an append-only `docs/DECISIONS.md`, every run writes a human-readable summary next to its transcript, and a per-run `docs/CHANGELOG.md` narrates the design history.

## What it is not

- **Not an autorouter.** Routing stays human or delegated; copperhead produces the DRC-clean draft that layout tools optimize from.
- **Not a new editor.** No walled garden; your KiCad install remains the editor.
- **Not the engineer of record.** A human signs off; the agent never claims a design is fab-ready beyond "ERC/DRC clean".

## Simple demo

From a checkout of this repo, run the smallest create-pipeline demo with the USB-C power breakout brief:

```bash
npm run demo:simple
```

The script creates or resumes a git repo at `demo-runs/usb-c-breakout/` and runs:

```bash
copperhead create --brief examples/simple/usb-c-breakout.md
```

Pass normal create flags after `--`, for example `npm run demo:simple -- --model claude`.
If a stage fails, rerun the same command; the demo repo keeps a baseline commit and ignores run transcripts so retries start from the last committed design state.

More briefs, including medium and hard tiers, live in [examples/](examples/).

## Maturity

Honest read of where the current release stands, so you can calibrate before pointing this at a board you care about:

- **Solid.** `init` and `check`/`verify` are deterministic, LLM-free, and covered by the offline test suite against a real KiCad fixture: scaffolding, ERC/DRC, the s-expression reader, drift detection, and fab export all run green in CI.
- **Implemented, not yet proven.** The agent loop (`do`, `sync --resolve`, `create`) is complete and structurally gated, but its acceptance tests need a live model and have not been observed passing end to end. Expect rough edges.
- **Always.** Every mutation runs inside a git snapshot and rolls back if verification fails, so the worst case is a no-op commit, not a mangled schematic. Work on a branch anyway.

## Open source

The entire tool (agent core, prompts, tools) is public under Apache-2.0, built on an open stack (KiCad, kicad-cli, [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec)). Everything it produces is plain markdown and JSON in your own repo: no proprietary formats, no lock-in. This is a Chouhan Industries project, and the same commitment that puts every hardware schematic in public applies to the tool that designs them.
